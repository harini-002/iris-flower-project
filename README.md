# iris-flower-project

This is a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the famous Iris dataset. The model is built using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used to train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree). The project includes data visualization, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction steps, and achieves good accuracy in identifying the flower species.
